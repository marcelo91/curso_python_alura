- Create a requirements.txt
I use pip freeze to get the packages I need into a requirements.txt file and add that to my repository. 
I tried to think of a way of why you would want to store the entire virtualenv, but I could not.


- Create a Venv with requirements.txt
Typically the steps you always takes are:
git clone <repo>
cd <repo>
pip install virtualenv (if you don't already have virtualenv installed)
virtualenv venv to create your new environment (called 'venv' here)
source venv/bin/activate to enter the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt to install the requirements in the current environment
